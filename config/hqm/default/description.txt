Welcome to Craft to Exile [Harmony]! Instead of linearized progression as in [Dissonance], [Harmony] focuses on compatibility and freedom. Mobs will always scale to the nearest player's level (the max level is 50). Explore the quest book to get an idea of what [Harmony] has to offer, then set your own goals and achieve them! Also, be sure to check out the Age of Exile handbook!
